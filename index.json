Ridiculous !!\nMom, remember that time when you bought a Lego car for Declan ? (BTW, he\u0026rsquo;s not my boyfriend, at least not yet !). I can\u0026rsquo;t believe that you won\u0026rsquo;t let me have it. You broke my heart. Fortunately they healed 2 minutes later when I saw a box of nails, then you decided to break my heart again by refusing me. Life was already hard enough !!\nDad, demember that time when we are about to go home after groceries shopping and you insisted on putting me back in the car seat? Why can\u0026rsquo;t you just let me wander around in the parking lot ? My life was totally ruined after that !!\n","permalink":"http://junosdiary.gihub.io/posts/2025-02-21-you-ruined-my-world/","summary":"I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many times you guys have have ruined my world, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost count, but here they are anyways, because even if you don\u0026rsquo;t remember them, I do !\n18 Months Memories Remember those times when I wanted to stay in bath for just two more hours so I can play with my watering can ?

My first picture was taken in the hospital, you know, taken by these alledgely professional photographers that charges you $200 for a few pictures. My first road trip was to the Atlantic Beach, and it was aweful ! (Yes, aweful, NOT awesome) My first full sentenc - 妈妈，去洗澡(Mama, go take a shower) My first pediatrician visit was pretty aweful, I thought the nurse was being nice to me, but instead she stuck something into my thigh !! What a pain in the thigh she is ! Non-Imporant Firsts My first book was a collection of \u0026ldquo;First xyz book for babies\u0026rdquo; My first toy was this baby toy that you hang above crib, and it played Chinese songs, that\u0026rsquo;s how I knew it was made in China.

Where I came from, who my mom is, and why I am here\nBirth I was born at 1:43 AM on 6/7/2023, weighted 7 pounds and 7 oz after my Mom strugged for 24 hours, allegedly anyways. Technically speaking, I am 20 months now, but I like to sound younger, I mean, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t these days?\nAt birth, it was supposed to be all sunny and shiny, you know, seeing the lights for the first time and all, but quite the contrary, it was all too dark. Well, again, allegedly, it was because my bilirubin level was too high, whatever that means, so I had to undergo treatment under UV for several days with my eyes covered in total dark.\nThere goes several days of no sunlight and I had no idea what was happening outsdie, not that I cared anyways. At least I think Dad and Mom were quite worried.\nMother My mom was a teacher, but now she\u0026rsquo;s my full-time personal assistant, without pay. The story I heard was that mom gave up everything she had in China and decided to move to the US with my Dad. Mom\u0026rsquo;s family disagreed with the relationship and mom fought back fiercely, and maintained the long distance relationship for years. Eventually, they got married, bought a house, and had me - the American dream come true I guess ?\nFather Dad is some sort of \u0026ldquo;network engineer\u0026rdquo;, I guess it must be difficult to connect with people these days that they need an engineer to help networking each other.\nI was born networking with two people already, it can\u0026rsquo;t be that hard, can it ?\nDad always talk to this little screen in front of him, or staring at it for hours, sometimes making noises hitting the board beneth. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Dad always likes to talking to the screen though, he definitely frown a lot when the word \u0026ldquo;aidn\u0026rdquo; is mentioned.\nJuno The Name It\u0026rsquo;s rumored that because Mom watched some video (YouTube actually) of this british/korean kid whoes name is also \u0026ldquo;Juno\u0026rdquo; and apparently she matches the image of what my mom saw in me. Oh, and of course, I was born in June, which probably contributed to \u0026lt;1% to the final decision. Oh well, but I won\u0026rsquo;t become what she imagined, I be me, no one else and that is Juno\u0026rsquo;s promise !\nThe Diary I figured it\u0026rsquo;s about time that I do something to channel my thoughts into words before I turn 18. You never know someday I might become famous and this would be how I tell folks about my childhood. Or maybe, just maybe, I needed this personal space for things that I can\u0026rsquo;t tell neither Dad nor Mom.\n","permalink":"http://junosdiary.gihub.io/posts/2023-06-07-i-was-born/","summary":"This is just a brief introduction to my family.
