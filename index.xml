      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many times you guys have have ruined my world, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count, but here they are anyways, because even if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember them, I do !
18 Months Memories Remember those times when I wanted to stay in bath for just two more hours so I can play with my watering can ? For unknown reasons, you just had to drag me out of it, and you keep doing it every day no matter how hard I cried each time !</description>

      <description>Born in 2023, started writing diary since 1 year old. I like to read and have been reading since 1.
I think I love my dad, at least I kiss him when he asked me to.
I really love my mom, she&amp;rsquo;s always gentle and loves to hug me. She never gets mad at me (at least as of this writing). I always go to her when dad yells at me.</description>

      <title>The first of everything</title>
      <link>http://junosdiary.gihub.io/posts/2024-12-11-the-first-of-everything/</link>

      <description>There are too many &amp;ldquo;firsts&amp;rdquo;, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember them all, some are fuzzy and some are clear. Either way, I can&amp;rsquo;t verify them, so writing them down is the only way to make sure that I don&amp;rsquo;t lie to whomever is going to interview me when I become famous.
Important Firsts My first words were &amp;ldquo;Dada&amp;rdquo;. (Sure Dad, whatever) Mom taught me to learn how to roll and sit. My first walk happened in Dad&amp;rsquo;s home office (no, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, I dare him miss my first baby step) My first kiss was given (or be given, if you know what I mean) to my Dad.</description>

      <title>I was born</title>
      <link>http://junosdiary.gihub.io/posts/2023-06-07-i-was-born/</link>

      <description>This is just a brief introduction to my family. Where I came from, who my mom is, and why I am here
Birth I was born at 1:43 AM on 6/7/2023, weighted 7 pounds and 7 oz after my Mom strugged for 24 hours, allegedly anyways. Technically speaking, I am 20 months now, but I like to sound younger, I mean, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t these days?
At birth, it was supposed to be all sunny and shiny, you know, seeing the lights for the first time and all, but quite the contrary, it was all too dark.</description>
